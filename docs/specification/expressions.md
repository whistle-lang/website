An expression in _Whistle_ evaluates to a value, this could be through either
[binary](#binary) or [unary expressions](#unary), or the special
[conditional expression](#conditional).

> In the future, once [PR #21](https://github.com/whistle-lang/whistle/pull/21)

## Unary

A unary expression can be one of two things, either a primary or an operation.
Due to the complexity and many different types of primary expressions the
specification for them can be found [here](./primary_expressions).
