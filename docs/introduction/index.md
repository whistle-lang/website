_Whistle_ is a new programming language developed by the
_[Whistle](https://github.com/whistle-lang)_ team and contributers. It is mainly
developed for the purpose of learning about the internals of programming
languages but also because it is fun to have created our very own programming
language. Currently _Whistle_ is in very early stages of development with no
plans of becoming a go-to language for any kind of serious project for the
foreseeable future. This will however not stop us from exploring it's limits to
further develop _Whistle_ and hopefully one day make it a useable language.
